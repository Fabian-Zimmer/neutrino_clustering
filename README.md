# N-1-Body CNB Simulation Code

**Authors:** Fabian Zimmer, Camila Correa, Shin'ichiro Ando

Repository containing codes to run relic neutrino simulations, which were specifically designed for the work of [2306.16444](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.16444). The scripts have also been designed to be interfaced with data from [2206.11298](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2830) present on the Snellius Computing Clusters at SURFsara in the Netherlands. 

For any questions about the codes and functions necessary to run such simulations or produce the figures in [2306.16444](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.16444), please contact f.zimmer@uva.nl.
